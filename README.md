# Clean - A Laravel Starter kit that's clean af

- Minimal Tailwind styles, that can be completely removed in the app.css if you want.
- Uses [Laravel Fortify](https://laravel.com/docs/12.x/fortify) to handle authentication, 2FA, etc.
- Intentially bare-bones so you can install whatever frontend you'd like without having to strip out existing components and structures.
